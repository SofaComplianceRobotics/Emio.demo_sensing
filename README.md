# Emio.demo_sensing

In this demo, we will explore the sensing capabilities of Emio. 

In this demo we fix the motor to a desired configuration. We chose a configuration that let us use Emio as a joystick. 
We track the position of the effector using a marker and the depth camera.
The problem we want to solve is to retreive the force applied by the user on the effector of Emio.
